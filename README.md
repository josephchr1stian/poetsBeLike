# poetsBeLike

This project was created in a two-day sprint so that I could practice using react, materialUI,  and API calls!

## How to play

You can select an author featured in the poetry database, and then type in three words. When you search through lines, you are returned every poem that contains any of your keywords in its contents. If you search through titles, you are searching through all poets, not just the one you select. Your score is the number of results you get. 

Poets be like : Love, death, rain.

## Bugs and issues

Sometimes you have to click on the search button more than once. 

Some poems are much longer than others, leading to some nasty styling issues.

I would like to come back and fix those once I am done with my current portfolio project.
